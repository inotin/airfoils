<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I really love planes and aviation in general. Even though I understand underlying principles and physics of an aircraft, it is always fascinating to see these beatiful machines flying. It's like magic. The main reason why they fly is the lift force generated by the wing. The lift force appears due to special geometry of an airfoil (cross section of the wing) which creates a zone of lower pressure above the wing and higher pressure under the wing. This pressure difference basically lifts the aircraft in the air (apart of magic, joking).
There are so many types of airfoils for different types of aircraft, different airspeeds and etc. Each of them has its individual set of aerodynamic properties, of which two major ones are:

* coefficient of lift (Cl), which describes how much lift wing with such shape generates
* coefficient of drag (Cd), which describes how much drag wing with such shape generates

One of the interesting tasks which aerospace engineers face is developing optimal airfoil with a certain lift to drag ratio. The traditional approaches is to conduct simulation (CFD analysis) using specialized software and then perform real experiments using wind tunnels. The results of such experiments are put into airfoil databases for further use. What I decided to do is to solve a reverse task, i.e. having a bunch of experimental results for certain geometries, predict aerodynamic properties for a previously unseen airfoil.

#### Dataset info

The dataset is really small by now and consists of 118 records of airfoils with corresponding aerodynamic properties.
The problem is that there are not many available sources, usually the this type of information is provided in the form of experimental report scans. Only few of them are digitized by enthusiasts, one of such files can be found here: Source
To solve this problem in the future it is possible to use CFD simulations for gaining new data or form a team which would digitize experimental reports

##### Features:

Coordinates of points froming an airfoil
Angle of attack - angle between airflow and airfoil which affects aerodynamic properties

##### Target variable:
Cl - coefficient of lift

### To-do
- [x] Data preprocessing
- [x] Visuals
- [x] Implement a Random Forest Model
- [ ] Build a NN model
- [ ] Obtain more data
- [ ] Create a script adapted for general usage


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/inotin/airfoils.git
   ```
